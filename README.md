# Barcelona .NET Core Meetup Group Setup Rules

Would you like to participate as an speaker or as an sponsor?

The Barcelona .NET Core Meetup group is a non profit but needs the help of both speakers and venues to organize events.
Sponsors (companies) can provide space and other benefits but can not provide speakers from the company, if a company wants a setup like that...

There are some basic rules:

- English is our language
- Sponsors, venues and companies can not provide speakers, speakers can work and promote a company but not the company that is hosting the meetup.
Anyway sponsors can have some time to promote theirselves and do marketing before starting the meetup.
